This unfinished c++ code used Java Native Interface (JNI) to interface 
	with the rest of the rocket code, which was written in Java. Parameters are
	passed using JSON in a string passed through JNI to the c++ code and back 
	to Java.
I was in the process of modifying this code to pass a JNI string back to the 
	Java as a return value, when I heard the news that we were replacing the 
	Java on the rocket with c++. Hurray! I have always been an advocate of not 
	running Java on a rocket, since an executing java program can just pause to
	do garbage collection instead of running your code, and you don't want your
	code to just pause execution for half a second on a rocket.
Now we can get rid of the JNI stuff, and most of the JSON stuff as well. We will
	still need to use some of the JSON stuff to read parameters for the filter 
	algorithm and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) when the rocket starts up.
You can use the code in this folder as a reference for development of the c++
	only code.
